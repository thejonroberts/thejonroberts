## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I love looking for ways to remove obstacles to getting quality features deployed - using containers, customizing rails generators, using AI assistants, automating repetitive tasks, writing faster test setups, generally removing headaches for me and my teammates. I work best in Ruby and JavaScript.

I'm a graduate of Indiana University, where I studied Mathematics & Education, and [Nashville Software School](https://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/), where I completed the 6 month full-stack Node.js program. I started my software career there in 2017.

Recently completed [Sandi Metz's 99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles) course (it's great). Currently learning code smells & refactoring recipes, more about rails generators, Go, and looking to contribute to open source projects.
