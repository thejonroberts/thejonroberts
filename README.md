## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I love shipping quality features and removing obstacles to shipping more of them. Currently freelancing, looking for an employer, learning Go, and contributing to open source projects.

I have recent contributions to Rails, Shopify, and Ruby for Good. I work best in Ruby and Javascript.

I'm a graduate of Indiana University, where I studied Mathematics & Education.  I started my software career in 2017 at Nashville Software School. I completed their 6 month full-stack Node.js program. I cut my teeth in the real world as a full stack developer at Beachy, a booking & hospitality SaaS startup.

Prone to obsess over: custom rails generators, update/deploy/task automation, test/CI/CD optimization, and writing maintainable code (OOP).

Recent reads/courses I loved: [Sandi Metz's 99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles), [Garrett Dimon's Frictionless Generators](https://generators.dev)
